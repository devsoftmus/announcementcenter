### 🛠️ State of maintenance

While there are many things that could be done to further improve this app, the app is currently maintained with **limited effort**, due to the following reasons:

* The main target use-cases are working fine
* I'm a backend developer, but the next bigger features (inline attachments, emoji picker, mentions, reactions, …) require more frontend knowledge and time
* My work-focus shifted away from this app

I will continue to provide the level of maintenance I can afford, which is:

* Taking care that the app continues to work
* Make sure an update is available for compatibility with new Nextcloud server releases
* Provide feedback and background information to new or existing features

While I'm personally limited in resources to further advance this app I would be more than excited if you want to collaborate with me. I will merge pull requests for new features and frontend fixes.
